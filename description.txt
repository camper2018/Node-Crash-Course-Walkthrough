Node is a Javascript runtime not a language or framework
Build on V8 Javascript engine (Google Chrome engine)
Written in C++
Essentially allow us to run Javascript code on the server (outside the browser environment).

Why Node:
Fast, efficient and highly scalable
Single threaded , Event driven, non-blocking I/O model. PHP is synchronous and multi-threaded so multiple threads or processes run at the same time and take up memory space
These can max out resources sometimes and since they are synchronous, each process has to finish before the next one is started. Node js is asynchronous and non-blocking
so increase throughput and availability.
Supports concurrency via events & callbacks. EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners.
Popular in the industry, open source, active developers community support
Same language on the front and back end.

Best Projects for Node:

Anything that is not CPU intensive. examples:
REST API & Microservices.
REAL Time Services (Chat, Live Updates)
CRUD Apps - Blogs, Shopping Carts, Social Networks
Tools & Utilities.
